Notes:

- Run the code in the same folder as needed input files with `python format_metadata_opencell.py`
    - It expects `opencell.metadata.csv` that are generated by our processing pipeline.
    - Other needed input files are included in this folder. See comments in code for where these input files come from.

- The Ensembl ID in image file names don't always match the Ensembl ID in `opencell-localization-annotations.csv` for the same reason above. Matching between images and metadata was done using gene names alone.
