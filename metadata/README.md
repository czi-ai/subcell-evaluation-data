Notes:

- Run the code in the same folder as needed input files:
    - allencell.metadata.csv or opencell.metadata.csv that are generated by our processing pipeline.
    - Other input files are included in this folder. See comments for where these input files come from.

- For AllenCell, replaced gene name `HIST1H2BJ` with HGNC name `H2BC11`; and `AAVS1` is a viral insertion site that does not have Ensembl ID.
